# Crypto VC Investment to FDV Ratio Analysis

## Introduction

This project provides an in-depth analysis of venture capital (VC) investments in the cryptocurrency space, with a focus on the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) ratio. It aims to help retail investors understand the impact of VC investments and the timing of token releases, enabling them to make more informed decisions and avoid potential pitfalls.

## Motivation

In the rapidly evolving world of crypto investing, it is crucial for retail investors to conduct thorough due diligence. Many new projects have FDVs that significantly exceed their circulating supplies, and understanding these metrics, especially the vesting periods of VC investors, is essential to avoid being dumped on when large quantities of tokens are released.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis was queried from [https://dune.com/queries/3855822](Dune), a powerful platform that provides access to on-chain data and allows users to create custom queries and dashboards. I attached a csv of the dataset extracted from my notebook in the repo.

## Analysis

The notebook includes:

1. **Data Collection**: Querying relevant data from Dune Analytics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Metric Calculation**: Calculating key metrics such as FDV, circulating supply, and the ratio between VC investments and FDV.
4. **Visualization**: Creating a dashboard to visualize the data and key metrics.
5. **Insights**: Providing detailed insights into the top new projects in the crypto space and the impact of VC investments.

## Key Metrics

- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)**: The total value of all tokens in a project if all tokens were in circulation.
- **Circulating Supply**: The total number of tokens currently available in the market.
- **VC Investment to FDV Ratio**: The proportion of the projectâ€™s FDV that is held by venture capital investors.

## Conclusion

Understanding the vesting periods of VC investors and the FDVs of crypto projects is crucial for retail investors to make informed decisions and avoid being negatively impacted by large token releases. This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis and a useful dashboard to aid in this understanding.
